                    Hi I'm Brooke, and I'm a video game developer. I love programming and UI/UX! <br /><br />

                    <!--I'm a 4th year Computer Game Science major at University of California, Irvine.-->
                    Video games have always been a huge part of my life and are a way for me to connect with friends and family and create fond memories.
                    My love of video games inspired me to learn how to make them myself so that I can help others create meaningful experiences and connections through my own video games.

                    <br /><br />
                    I have been creating video games since 2018 and have developed 10 video games so far and 2 tabletop games.
                    I am part of UCI's Video Game Development Club (VGDC) and have created several games within the club, many of which I was a team lead.
                    My favorite game that I've worked on is my ambitious senior Capstone project
                    <a class="aqua-link" target="_blank" href="https://jalagon.itch.io/craftaway">CraftAway</a>,
                    which was made in a team of 5 with the guidance of our mentor from Blizzard.
                    <br /><br />

                    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and board games, creating art, watching anime, and cuddling with my 2 adorable cats.
